# jumper

# In this game, it is similar to hangman. We are trying to save the jumper, and we can only do so by guessing correct letters and in the end the correct word. The jumper's parachute will lose a piece as a wrong letter is guessed. Once the game is over, despite winning or losing, you will be shown the correct word.

# Director: We use the director to run all parts of the game. In our GetInputs, we can guess the letters and in the DoUpdates and DoOutputs we can see how this affected our jumper.

# Jumper: In this class we created the design of the jumper. By doing jumper.add I was able to get rid of a row when a letter is guessed incorrectly.

# SecretWord: In this class I set the program to be linked to a .txt file with names from the scriptures. The words will be randomly chosen as our secret word for the game.
